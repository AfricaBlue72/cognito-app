As a user I want you to create an S3 bucket the host my static website files in.
The requirements are as follows:
- The bucket name must reflect the name of the web app, which is cognio-app
- The bucket name must reflect the name of the environment as stored in SSM Parameter "Environment"
- This S3 bucket is private and can only be accessed by CloudFront
- Unencrypted access to the bucket should not be possible.
- Can you also create a logging bucket where CloudFront can log to. The name of this logging bucket is the same as the hosting bucket but with "-logging" appended to it.
Can you create a Cloudformation for this in folder /backend/product/030_Buckets?
