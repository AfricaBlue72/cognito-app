I want to be able to convey certain items to the user of this web page.
We currently use an alert but they are tight to the page. It disappears with navigation.
Is the following possible:
-   Create a SnackBar that always appears at the bottom of the browsing window (i.e. at the bottom of the viewport)
-   This SnackBar must have a soft look in red for errors, orange for warnings and green for information
-   This SnackBar must be able to stay for a certain amount of seconds (configurable)
-   Alternatively the SnackBars stays permanent until the user clicks it away.
-   Can we start by implemnting this for the Login page. Where we remove the Alert and replace this with the SnackBar?

Once the signup has been done I want you to store the SignUpOutput in local storage.
We need the Next step later when the user closes the site and start it up again.

As a user I want you to create an S3 bucket the host my static website files in.
The requirements are as follows:
- The bucket name must reflect the name of the web app, which is cognio-app
- The bucket name must reflect the name of the environment as stored in SSM Parameter "Environment"
- This S3 bucket is private and can only be accessed by CloudFront
- Unencrypted access to the bucket should not be possible.
- Can you also create a logging bucket where CloudFront can log to. The name of this logging bucket is the same as the hosting bucket but with "-logging" appended to it.
Can you create a Cloudformation for this in folder /backend/product/030_Buckets?
