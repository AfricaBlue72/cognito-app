To summarize:

Use pnpm run dev for active development.
Use pnpm run build followed by serve out when you want to test your static export locally.
Run pnpm run build again whenever you make changes that you want to see in the static version.
The contents of the out directory after running pnpm run build are what you'll upload to S3 or another static hosting service when you're ready to deploy.
This workflow ensures that you can develop your Next.js app with all its dynamic features, while also being able to test and deploy it as a static site. If you have any more questions about this process or need help with any specific step, please feel free to ask.
